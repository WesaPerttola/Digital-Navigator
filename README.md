# Digital-Navigator

The 'Digital Navigator' macro simulates ancient sail-powered voyages using sequential least-cost path analysis based on deterministic time series wind data. It uses wind speed and direction rasters that can be created from NetCDF files with the 'Wind Data Batch Processor'. Both macros utilize ArcGIS Pro 2.5 tools and requires a Spatial Analyst licence to run. See upcoming article
